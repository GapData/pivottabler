Title: Create Pivot Tables natively in R
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Christopher", "Bailiss", email = "cbailiss@gmail.com",

Description: pivottabler enables regular pivot tables to be easily 
    created with just a few lines of R.  More complex pivot tables can 
    also be created, e.g. with irregular layouts, multiple calculations 
    and/or derived calculations based on multiple data frames.  
    This provides the R language with capabilities comparable to many 
    off-the-shelf/commercial reporting and data analysis applications.
